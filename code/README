# File: code/README

As I move my library into this "code" directory
each file importing from it will (probably) need the following:

from code import  <listing of files required from code>

The following is needed if code in this ("code") directory needs
modules located in 'code's parent directory:
    import os
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.split(sys.path[0])[0])

code/angie.py 
    accepts one of angie's csv files (after it has been subjected to
    the 'fromdos' command and has had the first line deleted)...
    and yields a listing which can be cut and pasted into the receipts
    file.
