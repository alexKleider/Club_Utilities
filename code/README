# File: code/README

this directory is where I'm developing some utilities,
the most active one having to do with resolving the csv
files Angie sends me with my records.  The major issue has
to do with the fact that names often don't match. (eg Bill 
vs William)
code/angie.py 
    accepts one of angie's csv files (after it has been subjected to
    the 'fromdos' command and has had the first line deleted)...
    and yields a listing which can be cut and pasted into the receipts
    file.

I've also thought about having a 'main.py' program in the parent
directory and modules it uses in this directory although so far
(as of Sat 05 Nov 2022 09:00:09 AM PDT) no moves have been made
in this direction.
If/when I do move my library into this "code" directory
each file importing from it will (probably) need the following:

from code import  <listing of files required from code>

See ~/Notes/Py/import_from_aove to solve problem of importing
from higher up the directory tree.
