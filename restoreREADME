Guide to Cloning the Repository and Restoring Backed up Data
============================================================

    $ cd
    $ mkdir Club  # Pick a name/location of your choosing.
    $ cd Club   # Move into what we'll call the project directory.
    $ git clone https://github.com/alexKleider/Club_Utilities
    $ mv Club_Utilities Utils  # Repos is cloned and renamed.
    $ mkdir Mnt  # Create a mount point for non repo data.
    $ su -  # Mounting requires root privileges.
    # cd ~<username>/Club  # Get root into the project directory.
    # mount /dev/sdb1 Mnt
    # exit   # No need for root privileges (unitl umounting.)
    $ LAST=`cat Mnt/Club/last`  # Pick up date of last backup.
    $ cp -a Mnt/Club/${LAST}/* ./  # Copy bu data => proj dir.
    #
    ## Now we deal with the directories that exist under
    ## the repo directory but are not part of the repo:
    ls -lA Archives/Data  # Note the <most-recent-time-stamp>.
    cp Archives/Data/<most-recent-time-stamp>.tar.gz ./
    $ tar xvzf <most-recent-time-stamp>.tar.gz
    $ rm  <most-recent-time-stamp>.tar.gz
    $ ls -lA <most-recent-time-stamp>  # A sanity check!
    $ mv <most-recent-time-stamp>/* Utils/
    $ rmdir <most-recent-time-stamp>
    $ cd Utils
    $ cp -a Notes/Mail/Dot/\. ~/  # Move dot files [2]
    $ cp ../exclude .git/info/  # Copy exclude file into git repo.
    $ workon p37  # Activate the venv.
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt  # Bring in dependencies
    $ .utils.py ?


[1] WARNING: Do NOT mount the backup media onto a mount point within
the project directory when doing back up! Create and Use ~/MntPoint.
    $ mkdir ~/Mnt
    # mount
Otherwise you'll get a recusive backup!!!
The above is only to restore data from backup.
[It would be better perhaps to modify the instructions so the mount
point is never in the project directory in order to avoid confusion.]

[2] The dot files have passwords redacted.  This will have to be
corrected before emailing will work.
