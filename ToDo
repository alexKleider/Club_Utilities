# File: ToDo

Add a "status" field:
    m for member
    a_ for applicant, 
        _ can be an integer: number of meetings attended or
        "a" for approved (but hasn't yet paid dues.)
    "" not member of on membership track- expect few if any of these.

Back up and Archiving: not quite the same thing but related.

Archiving pertains to when emails and letters are sent out:
Each time a mailing goes out, we want to create a (time-stamped)
directory into which we move all the letters as well as the json file
containing all the emails. (An alternative would be to simply move
the json file into the mailing directory and then rename it using
the time_stamp as the name.)
We then want to place that directory into Archives/Mailings/

Separate from the above (which also needs to be backed up onto
alternate media) we want to intermittently save the following files
found in the Py directory but excluded from the git repo:
    applicants
    extra_fees.txt
    memlist.csv
    newmembers
    receipts*.txt
    report*
    loose-ends
We do this by creating a yy-mm-dd directory within the Backup
directory and copying the above listed files into it.
In a sense this is archiving as well and should perhaps be put
into Archives/Py rather that Backup.

For backup, we can use rsync to save the contents of all the
directories under Mshp except for the Py directory.
