utils.prepare_mailing_cmd():
  Does a bunch of set up and then:
-   uses content.prepare_email_template  (differs gmail vs easy)
    to assign club.email used by member.append_email 
- calls member.prepare_mailing and terminates, but prepare_mailing 
does nothing more than simply call the functions specified by the
content_type and then populates the emails.json file (prn)!!
Usually the function specified is
    member.std_mailing()    but other possibilities are:.
    member.get_owing
    member.append2Dr  Not used, ???
    member.set_owing
    member.request_inductee_payment
