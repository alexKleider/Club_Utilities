# parts added when the above didn't work:
# $ cat demo_email | msmtp -a gmail akleider@sonic.net
# msmtp: account gmail from /home/alex/.msmtprc: tls requires either
# tls_trust_file (highly recommended) or tls_fingerprint or a disabled
# tls_certcheck
# Working but only because "Allow less secure apps: ON"
# This can be changed here:
