An outline of how emailing is done.

OVERVIEW
========

Emailer
-------
The mechanism for sending emails can be either through the use of
python modules (available in the Python Standard Library) or using
Bash utilities (accessible through the Python subprocess module.)
Hence the other option can be specified as follows:
--emailer [python|bash]  # The default is 'python'.

MTA
---
Each email must go out to an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) to be then
sent on through the Internet to its final destination.  All MTAs
require authentication before accepting emails; they don't accept
from just anybody- anybody could be sending out spam or worse.
I have access to my gmail account, the Club's gmail account, my
ISP (sonic) email account and through my account with easydns.com.
Hence the following as one of the command line arguments for the
send_emails command:
--mta [akg|clubg|sonic|easy]
# For club purposes it would make sense to use the Club's gmail
account but gmail won't accept emails unless security is lessened
and although possible, and fairly straight forward to do, it does
cause headaches. Google detects when such a change is made and
more often than not blocks emails until receiving a reassuring 
response to its warning email that such a change was made by an
authorized person. For this reason I prefer to use either Sonic
or Easydns.
If using gmail, change settings at
"https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps",
wait for the warning email (which comes very soon) and then
respond by reassuring them.  Only after doing so is it likely that
emails will be accepted.


Security
========
Each MTA has its own security needs and each emailer authenticates
in its own way. This sensitive information (passwords!) is kept in
a number of 'dot files' with highly restricted access rights) all
in the users home directory (~/) as specified by $HOME.
See the Dot directory for redacted examples.


The Reality
===========
As of the time of writing not all options are working. Stay tuned
for developments.
