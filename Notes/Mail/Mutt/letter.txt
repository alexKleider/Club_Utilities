The Bolinas Rod & Boat Club is experiencing problems using its 
gmail account when sending out emails with minutes attached.
We (Secretary Peter Pyle and I) are attempting a different mechanism.
Please forgive any duplication or any other glitches as we work
to get this remedied.

It is hoped that the minutes will get to you with this email.
