mutt 
       -a file [...]
              Attach  a file to your message using MIME.  When attaching
              single or multiple files, separating filenames and recipi‐
              ent  addresses  with  "--"  is  mandatory,  e.g.  mutt  -a
              image.jpg -- addr1 or  mutt  -a  img.jpg  *.png  --  addr1
              addr2.  The -a option must be placed at the end of command
              line options.

       -b address
              Specify a blind-carbon-copy (BCC) recipient

       -c address
              Specify a carbon-copy (CC) recipient

       -F muttrc
              Specify an initialization file to read instead of  ~/.mut‐
              trc

       -h     Display help.

       -H draft
              Specify a draft file which contains header and body to use
              to send a message.

       -i include
              Specify a file to include into the body of a message.

       -n     Causes Mutt to bypass the system configuration file.

       -s subject
              Specify the subject of the message.

       -v     Display the Mutt version number and  compile-time  defini‐
              tions.

       -vv    Display license and copyright information.

       --     Treat remaining arguments as addr even if they start  with
              a dash.  See also "-a" above.


muttrc can include:

       sendmail
              Type: path
              Default: “/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi”

              Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by
              Mutt.   Mutt expects that the specified program interprets addi‐
              tional arguments  as  recipient  addresses.   Mutt  appends  all
              recipients after adding a -- delimiter (if not already present).
              Additional flags, such as for $use_8bitmime, $use_envelope_from,
              $dsn_notify, or $dsn_return will be added before the delimiter.

       smtp_url
              Type: string
              Default: “”

              Defines  the  SMTP  smarthost where sent messages should relayed
              for delivery. This should take the form of an SMTP URL, e.g.:

              smtp[s]://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]

              where “[...]” denotes an optional part.  Setting  this  variable
              overrides the value of the $sendmail variable.


msmtp.man:

       Options specific to sendmail mode

              -f, --from=address
                     Set the envelope-from  address.  It  is  only  used  when
                     auto_from is off.
                     If  no account was chosen yet (with --account or --host),
                     this option will choose the first account  that  has  the
                     given  envelope-from address (set with the from command).
                     If no such account is found, "default" is used.

              -t, --read-recipients
                     Read recipient addresses from the To, Cc, and Bcc headers
                     of  the  mail  in addition to the recipients given on the
                     command line.  If any Resent- headers are  present,  then
                     the  addresses from any Resent-To, Resent-Cc, and Resent-
                     Bcc headers in the first block  of  Resent-  headers  are
                     used instead.

              --read-envelope-from
                     Read  the  envelope  from address from the From header of
                     the mail.  Currently this header must be on a single line
                     for this option to work correctly.
