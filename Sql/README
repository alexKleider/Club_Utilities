This Sql directory is where I'm experimenting with code that might
eventually lead to a transition to using a relational data base.
It's still very much a work in progress.

The Sanitized directory contains small 'dummy' data files
mimicing the club's data files.


The Letter subdirectory is where I'm playing around using sql
as a data base for generating letters as is done for the club
using a csv file.

Eg is a directory excluded from the repo; it contains an tutorial
example of an sql data base.
