Dear Janice,

Here's the procedure:

You'll receive an email with two attachments.

'Download' them both into your 'Desktop' folder.

Open up a terminal[1] and issue the following command:
    cd Desktop

Just to verify that all is as it should be-
    ls -l

This should produce a listing of files which should
include the two downloaded attachments- confirm that
this is the case.  The files will be 'jt.sh' and a
file that represents a date ending in '.tar.gz'

If this all checks out, be sure you are connected to 
your printer and then issue the following:
    source jt.sh

With a bit of luck, your printer will begin to do its thing.
Then there is only the matter of stuffing the envelopes with
the ouput of your printer and applying stamps.


Cheers,
Alex


[1]Once you know how to access your terminal,
it should all be pretty simple.
The following is one way to try:
press command + space bar (this brings up 'spotlight')
and then write "TERMINAL".
