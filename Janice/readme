This directory concerns my attempt to help a Mac User (Janice)
print the letters- the problem is to have her retrieve the attachments
I send, extract the letters and then to print them.
The attachments I send consist of a zipped version of the output of
the ./utils.py prepare_mailings command and a bash script (jt.sh) for
her to 'source.'  It extracts, deletes the json file (containing
emails,) prints the remaining letters, and then cleans up after itself
making the whole process idempotent.

Her downloads some time or at least at one time seemed to go to the
following directory:
/Users/janicetweedy/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Mail\ Downloads/
This seems to no longer be relevant.
