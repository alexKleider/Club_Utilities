Assume '1' based numbering:

            Rows      Columns
Sender in   5..8      6..29
Recipient   14..18    6..34

Fold along bottom of row 22
(through the "Dear <recipeint>" line.)



How to make letters 'fit' the windowed envelopes seems to be printer
dependent!  Hence we should probably set up a 'PrinterSpecs' class;
For now, note that for the printer in the Bolinas data closet:
The sender's address and recipient's address and the "Dear" line
should begin on lines 6, 15 and 23 respectively.
Lines should be indented 8 spaces.
A date can be on line 11.
A "Re: {subject}" line is best on line 21.
If one places "Dear {recipient}" on line 23 then making
the first fold through it will make the appropriate
text line up nicely inside the envelope windows.
