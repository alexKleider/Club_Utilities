This repository provides ./label.py

It grew out of my frustration over not being able to print labels from
a spredsheet (in my capacity of Membership Secretary for a local club.

Simply export your spreadsheet into a csv text file
and use it as input for ./label.py

Currently input (and output) files are hard coded so you'll have to
change the code to suit you particular data base but that shouldn't be
very difficult.  

The blank label page specifications are defined in one class.
Another class specifies which data base and the specifics of which
fields are used.
