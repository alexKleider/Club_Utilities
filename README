This repository was begun to provide ./label.py

It grew out of my frustration over not being able to print labels from
a spredsheet (in my capacity of Membership Secretary for a local
club.)

It has since grown into a bigger project that provides many things all
under the umbrella of ./utils.py: try...
  ./utils.py -h  # very verbose,
or simply
  ./utils.py ?  # more succinct.

It now provides a lot of functionality related to membership secretary
duties (Bolinas Rod & Boat Club) and is based on memlist.csv, the
club's 'master membership list' and to a lesser extent on the
'google.csv' file importable from the clubs gmail account.

Other notes (largely to myself:)

For letters to 'fit' the windowed envelopes:
The sender's address, recipient's address and the "Dear" line
should begin on lines 3, 12 and 19 respectively.
Lines should be indented 8 spaces.

Code is backed up on github.com
Backup for club data is generously provided by the secretary:
    memlist.csv
    checks_received
