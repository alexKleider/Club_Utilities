This repository was begun to provide ./label.py

It grew out of my frustration over not being able to print labels from
a spredsheet (in my capacity of Membership Secretary for a local
club.)

It has since grown into a bigger project that provides many things all
under the umbrella of ./utils.py: try...
  ./utils.py -h  # very verbose,
or simply
  ./utils.py ?  # more succinct.

It now provides a lot of functionality related to membership secretary
duties (Bolinas Rod & Boat Club) and is based on memlist.csv, the
club's 'master membership list' and to a lesser extent on the
'google.csv' file importable from the clubs gmail account.

Other notes (largely to myself:)

For letters to 'fit' the windowed envelopes:
The sender's address and recipient's address and the "Dear" line
should begin on lines 6, 15 and 23 respectively.
Lines should be indented 8 spaces.
A date can be on line 11.
A "Re: {subject}" line is best on line 21.
If one places "Dear {recipient}" on line 23 then making
the first fold through it will make the appropriate
text line up nicely inside the envelope windows.

Code is backed up on github.com
Backup for club data is generously provided by the secretary:
    memlist.csv
    checks_received.txt
    extra_fees.json
