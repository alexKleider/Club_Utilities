This repository was begun to provide ./label.py

It grew out of my frustration over not being able to print labels from
a spredsheet (in my capacity as Membership Secretary for a local
club.)

It has since grown into a bigger project that provides many things all
under the umbrella of ./utils.py: try...
  ./utils.py -h  # very verbose,
or simply
  ./utils.py ?  # more succinct.

It now provides a lot of functionality related to membership secretary
duties (Bolinas Rod & Boat Club) and is based on memlist.csv, the
club's 'master membership list' and to a lesser extent on the
'google.csv' file importable from the clubs gmail account.

Other notes (largely to myself:)

How to make letters 'fit' the windowed envelopes seems to be printer
dependent!  Hence we should probably set up a 'PrinterSpecs' class;
For now, note that for the printer in the Bolinas data closet:
The sender's address and recipient's address and the "Dear" line
should begin on lines 6, 15 and 23 respectively.
Lines should be indented 8 spaces.
A date can be on line 11.
A "Re: {subject}" line is best on line 21.
If one places "Dear {recipient}" on line 23 then making
the first fold through it will make the appropriate
text line up nicely inside the envelope windows.

Code is backed up on github.com
Backup for club data is generously provided by the secretary:
    memlist.csv
    checks_received.txt
    extra_fees.lst

Work flow:
As memtioned above, the club data is kept in
    memlist.csv,
    extra_fees.lst and
    checks_received.txt
These files are copied to ../Backup/ from time to time to protect
against accidental corruption.
They each of a specific format.
