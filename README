This repository was begun to provide ./label.py

It grew out of my frustration over not being able to print labels from
a spredsheet (in my capacity of Membership Secretary for a local
club.)

It has since grown into a bigger project that provides many things all
under the umbrella of ./utils.py: try...
  ./utils.py -h
